<p>On October 22, I had to go to the university to collect my friend’s degree certificate as he couldn’t come to collect it himself as he works at a different city now. I started my day early and went to the university at 8h00. There, I met some colleagues. Then, at 12h30 I went to collect the degree of my friend. The secretary there was super nice. The elderly lady is a fan of the Beatles. I am a huge fan myself. Coincidentally, I was wearing a Beatles t-shirt. We had a nice conversation for sometime. She was happy to know that I was going to be here for four more years for my PhD. She even came near my office after sometime. At the office, I tried to do some work (literature studies) and printed some of those papers. I always print when I am at the university because I prefer reading from a physical print out instead from a electronic version. At 13h00, I had a meeting with my daily supervisor about my PhD progress. He gave me some insights about Doppler Radars in general.</p>

<p>While coming back home, I grabbed a kapsalon and later I had it for dinner at home. Then, I watched “Boy meets world” and after a few episodes, I called it a night.</p>

<h3 id="schedule-23102020">Schedule 23/10/2020</h3>

<p>On October 23, first, unexpectedly I woke up at 4h00 which was super early. I woke up from a dream. I wanted to remember and write it. It was a super weird but really interesting dream. I was with my cousins on a rooftop. There were some people from a space agency who were showing us some objects in the sky. One of my cousins tried to hold a piece of glass and suddenly the sky looked really different. It looked like a curved piece of glass and the patterns on one side were moving to the other when he moved the piece of glass on his hand. It was like a remote control. Then, he tried to go to the edge of the roof hoping that he would see some new objects from one side of the sky. However, the people from the agency pointed out that the pattern will repeat and it won’t show anything new from what he had seen before. Then, an interesting thing happened. They got a signal on their system and when they debugged, they found that the signal has come from two thousand light years. It looked like a small lego-house and it had “Einstein” written on it. It was super weird, because if the house had taken off from Earth, the event must have happened at least two thousand years back (assuming that the house is traveling at maximum speed allowed.). It can be certainly more than two thousand years. And before two thousand years, there was no person as “Einstein”. This weird dream came to an end and I woke up. I guess based on some Freud theories, I think this is a consequence of the fact that in the recent TV series and movies that I have been watching, I am hearing the term “Einstein Rosen Bridge” a lot. And as a physics enthusiast, I know it is related to worm-holes. So, there is a possibility that this house has experienced something similar and now is at a different galaxy. I have my scribble at 4h00 is attached here in this blog-post. I slept again after writing it.</p>

<p><img src="/images/dream_23102020.jpeg" alt="Dream of 23/10/2020"></p>

<p>I woke up at 10h00. I received an email from <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aboutyou.nl</code> that the package that I had ordered was arriving soon. I got the package at 14h00.</p>

<p><img src="/images/converse.jpeg" alt="Order from aboutyou.nl"></p>

<p>It was delivered to my neighbor. I had ordered a pair of all star Chuck Taylor red <img class="emoji" title=":heart:" alt=":heart:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/2764.png" height="20" width="20"> and one one Levi’s stay loose denim (Which is made out of a sustainable material). This thing is trendy and cool too. <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"> They both look amazing together. I got them with a discount.</p>

<p><img src="/images/denim.jpeg" alt="Denim"></p>

<p>Then, I started preparing my talk for the seminar. I was about to present to my group at the university about how to use the group’s computing servers for MATLAB and for FEKO simulations. I had some problems in the beginning related to screen sharing online with Microsoft Teams, but I managed to offer a nice talk. It got over at 16h00 and the audience liked the overview. The session was recorded so that the new students/employees can look it up for references in future. I need to update the presentation and paste it inside the network drive of the group next week.</p>

<p>At 18h00, I was already hungry. I went to lidl to bring some stuff. I brought some chicken drumsticks and I cooked my home style (odia style) chicken curry with mustard oil. Then, I watched some “Boy meets world” and called it a night.</p>
