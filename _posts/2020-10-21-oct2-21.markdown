### Schedule

These two days had similar schedule. I woke up early. I started doing the presentation about the servers for the group for half day. I started reading some papers on atmospheric remote sensing and turbulence modeling. I used another half day for that. Although, I started reading the papers, I didn't utilize the entire half day on it. My legs were aching a lot. This is due to the fact that on Monday, I had to come down 21 floors in the faculty building due to a minor fire. Therefore, I slept in between while studying on the second half of the day.

As usual, in the evening I cooked dinner with my friend and watched the series "Boy meets world". 

#### New log (Lostarmour log 21.10.20.1)

* Please read some more papers per day to catch up the pace of the Ph.D. work.  
* Have to clear some things out about my Ph.D. short term requirements with the daily supervisor on Thursday. 
* Finally stopped playing `among us`.
