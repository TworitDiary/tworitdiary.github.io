### Schedule 

It was a happy weekend. On Friday, I had a midterm to attend from a master student. It was about antennas and optimization. I really enjoyed it and also asked many questions. After work, I started a movie marathon on disney+. It was all from Marvel. I watched three movies. Had some nice dinner and slept very late. 

On Saturday, woke up very late. I again started watching Marvel. I cooked some Coq-au-vin-blanc chicken but with some piri piri touch to it. It was delicious. Forgive my pathetic photography skills.

Sunday also pretty much went the same way. I had to go to buy a cake in the afternoon for the birthday of one of my house-mates. The supermarket was crowded. We celebrated his birthday at night. 

#### New log (Lostarmour log 18.10.20.1)

* Start writing the presentation about the department servers. I need to do an introduction about how to use the RedHat Linux servers for different purposes along with how to debug the frequent problems that occur in them for the employees and also for the new master students in our group. Will be fun sharing my experience. 

* Stop wasting so much time in weekends. Please read some papers to catch up the pace of the Ph.D. work.
