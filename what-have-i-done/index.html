<p>I haven’t been blogging since 23rd October 2020. Now, I think this blog site will just remain active once in a while because now, writing every day is not possible. From October till December end, it was quite an exciting journey for me.</p>

<p>The pandemic is never-ending and that we have the new strain of coronavirus from the UK, all hell broke loose. In the Netherlands, there is a strict lock-down from December 15th, 2020 till January 19, 2021. I am writing this blog post on the new year day 1st January 2021. Although, the start date of a new year is a man-made convention to translate the cosmic phenomena of one full rotation time of the Earth around the Sun, with all the excitement, joy, hope, and beliefs of people about a brand new year make the same man-made convention so much more interesting. Having said that, I still remember when my mom woke me up on the new year’s day morning of 2000. That was already 21 years ago. I was 6 years, 6 months and 21 days old <img class="emoji" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f61b.png" height="20" width="20"> .</p>

<p>If someone is reading this in the future, just know that I am writing this in an unusual excitement, so please do not mind my English <img class="emoji" title=":wink:" alt=":wink:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f609.png" height="20" width="20"> . We used to live in asbestos roofed cozy and small house with a veranda outside. I wish I had a picture of that house. I remember her exact words. They were “Uthe, aji nua barsa. Dui hazar masiah heigala. Nua Shatabdi”. This is in my mother tongue Odia and it translates to “Get up, today is new year’s day. It is the year two thousand. A new century has begun.” I don’t know if she was really excited for that day or it was just a way to get me off bed early. On 2021 new year’s day, we video called with each other. She didn’t like my long hair though <img class="emoji" title=":stuck_out_tongue:" alt=":stuck_out_tongue:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f61b.png" height="20" width="20"> .</p>

<h4 id="schedule">Schedule</h4>

<p>The schedule was pretty much the same as before. In the last two months, I did a literature review on some radar retrieval techniques for weather models. It was interesting as well as a little out of my comfort zone. I learned about dynamic estimation problems like Kalman and Particle filtering. Now, I am going more towards formulating the solution to my research questions of the Ph.D. work. I hope I will find a way.</p>

<p>The schedule broke when I asked my supervisors for two weeks long leave before the new year. Although everyone is generally on leave on these days because of Christmas and New Year, I had also an added reason for taking holidays. I had been constantly working since February 2020 without a break. I finished my master thesis in August 2020 and immediately started the Ph.D. which was very tiring.</p>

<p>During the holidays I had plans to visit the art museums of the Netherlands. However, with the announcement of the lock-down, all the museums were closed. Therefore, I stayed at home most of the time and got a little creative while cooking. I made some experiments and cooked some amazingly tasty food during the holidays. I even got some nice Christmas gifts from the department of the University.</p>

<p>As a mandatory ritual, I watched Home Alone 2, lost in New York on the Christmas Eve. <img class="emoji" title=":smile:" alt=":smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f604.png" height="20" width="20"></p>

<p>Apart from that, I visited my uncle’s family for two days in The Hague as they moved here for a job for three years. It is good to have family nearby. I played with my little cousins. One is eleven and the other one is six years old.</p>

<p>Holidays got over with the blink of an eye. I also had some issues during this period and due to that, I was always busy fixing something or the other. On 26th December, there was a thunder storm in the Netherlands and the wind speed reached 100 [km/hr]. That night the operator spring of my window broke and for the same reason, the window had a full 180-degree rotational freedom, which is not nice. <img class="emoji" title=":worried:" alt=":worried:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f61f.png" height="20" width="20"> I tried fixing it but the window never closed fully. There was always a gap and the wind just found a way to swing the window to its maximum potential and bring it back to normal. I imagined the wind wearing a savage t-shirt where it says “Break, Swing, Repeat”  I tried sleeping in the same condition. However, the wind was too fast and the temperature outside was three degrees on the Celcius scale [with a “feels like temperature” of negative one due to the rain]. Thanks to my curtain, heater plate, and duvet, I slept peacefully at around five in the morning after all the struggle to fix the window. Even with all that temporary fix, I woke up several times with the sound of the collision of the windowpane.</p>

<p><img src="/images/Broken_win1.jpg" alt="Broken window 1">
<img src="/images/Broken_win3.jpg" alt="Broken window 3"></p>

<p>The next morning when I was having my lunch downstairs, I heard a cracking noise and when I came up to my room, I found the outer layer of the glass broken due to the hard collision on one side. Then, I tied the handle of the swinging part of the window (don’t know how it is called) with a rope to the heater plate. This temporary fix worked like a charm. Now, I am waiting for the repair team to come and fix that.</p>

<p>The other issue that I had recently was a more annoying one. It was the smell of a dead mouse inside and outside of the room. I couldn’t find the source of the smell. While debugging the source, my nose experienced olfactory fatigue very easily. Finally, I found that it came from the highest shelf of my cupboard. I tried checking it, but I couldn’t find it. Suddenly, I smelled the ceiling and I got the most sensitive spot. Then, I confirmed that the thing that is dead is in the attic. That explains why I don’t hear the faint noises that I used to hear before from the attic. With all that information, I realized that I couldn’t do anything else. Going inside the attic is a hell of a task. I dropped that plan and I found that the smell is not that intense inside the room. I bought some scented candles from Lidl as they were there from the time of Christmas. I never knew that I would be needing them for this reason. Anyway, I bought six of those and lit up three by the side of my window. The candles are old I guess and that is the reason I don’t smell something out of them very strong. However, it kind of did the job with some added room fresheners.</p>

<p>On the holiday season, with all the neighboring decorations made by people, my room didn’t feel excluded after I lit up those candles. It looks beautiful in the evening.</p>

<p>Overall, the year 2020 was not all that bad. I graduated cum laude in the middle of the pandemic from the master’s program at TU Delft. A memorable event indeed. I received my Ph.D. offer as well in the middle of the pandemic. I am grateful to everyone who was a part of my journey directly or indirectly. I hope this pandemic ends soon and I wish everyone good health and mental stability this coming year. I look forward to working harder in the new year with some lifestyle changes (healthy <img class="emoji" title=":sweat_smile:" alt=":sweat_smile:" src="https://github.githubassets.com/images/icons/emoji/unicode/1f605.png" height="20" width="20">). Hopefully, I will contribute something to the development of society in the coming year. Fingers crossed.</p>
